Ha ha ha [?]  I was on the beach, but I was thinking about the bay Got to the bay, but by then I was far away I was on the ground but looking straight into the sun But the sun went down and I couldn't find another one For awhile For because it was an all-burning feeling in my chest To fill the void Of a long night unwatched by, well, the sun Until the morn Until when, well, the sun's reborn And so am I From all the scorn buried deep Within the psyche of my soul I was standing down but I was also on the run In my mind  I was on the radio talking with a friend of mine There wasn't no format because well, we like it like that He was out of his mind and I was way out of mine Then everything went backwards With words coming out Bassackwards And I appreciate him to the utmost degree</td>\n",
